# Surrealist writing app :writing_hand::eye:(App de Escritura surrealista)

This is web application where we can play to what surrealists artists (back in 1920's) called "Cadavre exquis": a game in which players write in turns on a sheet of paper, fold to conceal what they have written, and pass it on to the next player â€“ but adapted so that we can play it online!

## :mortar_board: **What did I learn from this project**

I feel that I learned the importance of shaping ideas by first thinking of a file structure. I discovered that thinking in terms of components, modules, the way they are distinguished, but also the way they communicate with each other is a very creative thing to do. And that I enjoyed it a lot (despite being buried under a mountain of post-its :shushing_face:).
